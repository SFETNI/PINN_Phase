While PhyCRNet provides a strong foundation for certain dynamic simulations, it encounters significant limitations in evolving microstructures, 
particularly due to overfitting and lack of generalization. The model rapidly overfits without effectively capturing broader spatiotemporal dependencies,
 resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Attempts to expand the RNN architecture by adding additional GRU or LSTM cells have not resolved this issue,
  as increased complexity alone fails to improve the model's adaptability. Similarly, adding extra loss functions or applying standard regularization techniques, such as BatchNorm,
   L1/L2 regularization, or latent losses, has proven insufficient in addressing the overfitting problem. These limitations underscore the need for an FNN-based 
   architecture within the framework, as the addition of an FNN could offer more robust spatial learning capabilities, enhancing the modelâ€™s generalization and stability across complex, 
   evolving microstructures.
